Part 1)
First do a practice Run and follow these tutorials to setup a Repo, and modify the readme (similar as to what was done in class lecture).

Make a HelloWorld type Repo (see https://docs.github.com/en/github/getting-started-with-github/quickstart).  You are basically going to be doing the Setup Git, Creating your Repo (https://docs.github.com/en/github/getting-started-with-github/create-a-repo), followed by Creating a Pull Request (https://docs.github.com/en/github/collaborating-with-issues-and-pull-requests/creating-a-pull-request), and finally merge the pull Request (https://docs.github.com/en/github/collaborating-with-issues-and-pull-requests/merging-a-pull-request )
Now that we have done a quick demo run.  Now letâ€™s do:

#)	Setup the Repo to require approvers (see lecture and slide deck)
#)	Add you group member and olekaspt@uc.mail.edu and TA (nagamasa@mail.uc.edu )
#)	Setup a pull request for yet another simple readme file change and put your partner down as approver.
#)	Approve each others readme changes
#)	Merge the pull the request

The end result should be a ReadMe file that was modified by two different users.  And there should be two separate close Pulled Requests.

Prepare a PDF (it makes is easier for TA to grade).
#)	Show link to your github repo.
#)	Show list of closed pull requests (like below)
