# SA_Assignment0

## Part 1
First do a practice Run and follow these tutorials to setup a Repo, and modify the readme (similar as to what was done in class lecture).

Make a HelloWorld type Repo (see https://docs.github.com/en/github/getting-started-with-github/quickstart).  You are basically going to be
doing the Setup Git, Creating your Repo (https://docs.github.com/en/github/getting-started-with-github/create-a-repo), followed by 
Creating a Pull Request (https://docs.github.com/en/github/collaborating-with-issues-and-pull-requests/creating-a-pull-request),
and finally merge the pull Request (https://docs.github.com/en/github/collaborating-with-issues-and-pull-requests/merging-a-pull-request )
Now that we have done a quick demo run. 

Now letâ€™s do:

1.	Setup the Repo to require approvers (see lecture and slide deck)
1.	Add you group member and olekaspt@uc.mail.edu and TA (nagamasa@mail.uc.edu )
1.	Setup a pull request for yet another simple readme file change and put your partner down as approver.
1.	Approve each others readme changes
1.	Merge the pull the request

The end result should be a ReadMe file that was modified by two different users.  And there should be two separate close Pulled Requests.

Prepare a PDF (it makes is easier for TA to grade).
1. Show link to your github repo.
1.	Show list of closed pull requests (like below)
